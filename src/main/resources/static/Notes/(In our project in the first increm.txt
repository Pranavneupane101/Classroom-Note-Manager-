(In our project in the first increment we selected the dataset and learned how to pass the malacious attacks through mininet and detect it through the wire shark and in the second increment we preprocessed the selected data then we we passed the data to train the Fknn and lstm model. Now in further iteration we will integrate the model with the Mininet and detect multiple attacks through it. ) 


The paper "Network Intrusion Detection Based on LSTM and Feature Embedding" proposes a novel approach to intrusion detection in networks, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system detects a variety of attacks, including DoS (Denial of Service), Probe, U2R (User to Root), and R2L (Remote to Local) attacks. The researchers used the NSL-KDD dataset for experimentation. The study uses feature embedding to enhance feature representation, making it easier for the model to understand and detect complex patterns in network data. The system's output demonstrated high accuracy in detecting various attacks, outperforming traditional intrusion detection methods. Using LSTM allowed the model to better understand the sequential nature of network traffic, leading to improved detection rates. This methodology also showed that the combination of feature embedding and LSTM significantly enhanced the model's performance in identifying complex attack patterns.
In conclusion, the research shows that using LSTM-based models, along with effective data preprocessing and feature embedding, can provide a robust solution for network intrusion detection, capable of identifying various types of malicious activities in a network with high accuracy of 83% in multi-classification.
